Hi, I am Terrence Benade.

I am an aspiring polyglot software craftsman living in beautiful Melbourne, Australia. I am the doting father of two beautiful girls, who well and truly have me wrapped around their fingers.

My wife is Kate Benade is a beautiful crafty soul who keeps me in line while sharing her passion for [paper creations](http://katebenade.wordpress.com/).

I am very fortunate to currently be working as a Agile Software Architect at [SEEK](http://www.seek.com.au/work-for-seek)
