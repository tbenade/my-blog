# Be all you can be

If I don't say it every day I must say it to developers every week. "Be selfish".
While the world seems bathed in endless capital to get the next big thing to market
the one thing we are well short of is skilled and impassioned developers.

Having had a wonderfully happy and successful .Net career I have no bug to bear.
My belly is round and voluminous with all the riches it has provided me but the
grip of its allure saddens me. In a very reasonable and inspiring conversation today
with some of the smartest people I am sure to ever meet there was still this niggling
fear of letting go of what they know for pastures possibly greener.

If we play this back as professionals and technologists who's near every thought
revolves around pragmatic problem solving we would never allow our customers to
make such bizarre loyalty based decisions if we could help it.
